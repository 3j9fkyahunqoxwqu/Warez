* You agree that this is not a project to argue about morality.

* If you find that a listed website is involved into some kind of drama make a pull request and I will review it in order to verify if the claim are true or not.

## Issue ticket system

The **Issue ticket system is closed** because everyone is permitted to create a pull request which is good enough in my eyes. I simply don't like to waste my spare time with pointless issue tickets, there is a Discord/Twitter Channel for such reasons which are the better  platforms to talk about findings or the project itself.

### Pull Requests

- [x] Linked Websites must be malware free, if it requires a VPN/proxy it must be mentioned due to privacy reasons.
- [x] All pages must include a proper language code e.g. (Ger) for Germany etc. 
- [x] Don't argue about morality here. We all have our reasons.
- [x] If something is wrong or missing just make a PR (_see below how to do that!_)
- [x] No page except ThePirateBay should include dangerous ads or coin-miners (TPB is the only exception).
- [x] Not every software/provider gets listed (for a reason), alternatives are cool but there should be reviewed and checked if it makes sense to mention them.
- [x] No drama or bitch fighting, if a page is involved into such things it automatically lands on the banned list.
