## Contributing Guidelines

- [x] Issue ticket system is closed
- [x] Submitted pages must be malware free, if it requires a VPN/proxy it must be mentioned due to security reasons.
- [x] All pages must include a proper language code e.g. (Ger) for Germany etc. 
- [x] Don't argue about morality here. We all have our reasons.
- [x] If something is wrong or missing just make a PR (_see below how to do that!_)
- [x] No page except ThePirateBay should include dangerous ads or coin-miners (TPB is the only exception).
- [x] Not every software/provider gets listed (for a reason), alternatives are cool but there should be reviewed and checked if it makes sense to mention them.
- [x] No drama or bitch fighting, if a page is involved into such things it automatically lands on the banned list.
